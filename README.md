4.	DATA DESIGN
Tables
1.	Students:
o	Student ID (PK), Name, Age, Gender, Balance_Fees, Enrollment Date, College ID (FK).
2.	Colleges:
o	College ID (PK), Name, Location, Affiliation.
3.	Universities:
o	University ID (PK), Name, Location, Established Year.
Relationships
•	Students belong to a college (linked via College ID).
•	Colleges are affiliated with a university (linked via University ID).
•	Financial details are tied to individual students.

5.	IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Phase 1: Database Setup
•	Design and create tables with robust normalization to avoid redundancy.
•	Establish primary and foreign key relationships for referential integrity.
Phase 2: Functional Query Development
•	Retrieval Queries:
o	Fetch student details with specific conditions (e.g., fees > 50,000).
o	List colleges with the highest student enrollments.
•	Analytical Queries:
o	Use RANK and DENSE_RANK to highlight top fee-contributing students.
o	Implement aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) for financial summaries.
•	Transformative Queries:
o	Apply string manipulations (CONCAT, SUBSTR) to enhance outputs.
o	Use CASE and DECODE for conditional categorizations.
Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
•	Generate dynamic reports for:
o	Top students and colleges by fee balances.
o	Universities with maximum affiliations.
•	Incorporate LEAD and LAG for comparative temporal insights.
Phase 4: Visualization and Reporting
•	Create views for key stakeholders:
o	Top Fee-Balanced Students by College.
o	Affiliation Summaries by University.
•	Generate insights on:
o	Revenue tracking.
o	Enrollment patterns.

6.	VISION
Empower educational institutions with a robust, centralized data system to streamline operations, track student progress, manage affiliations, and generate actionable insights for informed decision-making.
